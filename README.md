## Terraform Provider for digital ocean

> ref: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/digitalocean/digitalocean/latest/docs

In this tutorial, you used Terraform to build a load-balanced web infrastructure on DigitalOcean, with two Nginx web servers running behind a DigitalOcean Load Balancer. You know how to create and destroy resources, view the current state, and use Terraform to configure DNS entries.

Now that you understand how Terraform works, you can create configuration files that describe a server infrastructure for your own projects. The example in this tutorial is a good starting point that demonstrates how you can automate the deployment of servers. If you already use provisioning tools, you can integrate them with Terraform to configure servers as part of their creation process instead of using the provisioning method used in this tutorial.
